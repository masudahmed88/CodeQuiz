CodeQuiz

Created an html and css for both the quiz page and the high scores page.

On JS i created a variable called "questions" and then set properties within them that asked the question gave all the options and also the correct answer. 

If the wrong answer is selected the timer decreases by 15 seconds. 

After completing the quiz the user is able to view his score. Add their initals and submit the score into the High scores list. The user can clear the scores which will erase all results from the score list. 

User can also click the View High Scores link to view high scores.
